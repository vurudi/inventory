I have implemented multiple methods in this project, but I will focus on the key areas to ensure
that you understand the changes made to enable the project to perform CRUD operations successfully.
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete, which are fundamental concepts in data management.


First and foremost, the data was previously loaded from a static point, meaning that it was hard-coded
and could not be permanently modified. Instead, any modifications to the data were made during runtime
and were lost thereafter.

In contrast to static data, dynamic data is data that is generated or obtained at runtime from various
sources such as databases. In order to enable CRUD operations on the data, an external data source was
created and integrated into our application. This enables the application to perform updates, inserts,
reads, and deletes on the data in the external data source.

To ensure the project can successfully perform CRUD operations, several modifications were made to the code

    1. The first step was to correct the prepareData() function in the HomeControl.java class to retrieve data from the
    inventory_data.csv file.
    2. Next, the addNewPart() function was modified to enable the addition of new records to the CSV file under the part
    table. Similarly, the addNewProduct() function was modified to enable the addition of new records to the CSV file
    new product .
    3. The updatePart() and updateProduct() functions were also modified to enable the updating of records in the CSV file.
    4. The deleteProductSelected() and deletePartSelected() functions were modified to enable the deletion of records from
    the CSV file.
    5. Finally, the productModifyButtonAction() and partModifyButtonAction() functions were modified to allow for the deletion
    of updated records from the CSV file.




It is important to note that the data in this application is being read from and written to a file, specifically
the inventory_data.csv file. As a result, I have taken into consideration all possible file exceptions that could
occur when accessing this file.


It is important to note that several modules were imported into the project. Therefore, it is recommended to import
 the necessary modules if errors are highlighted due to missing imports.

It is essential to emphasize that the project requires a .csv file reader extension to access data from a .csv file.
If the extension is not installed, the IDE will prompt you to do so, and an internet connection will be necessary.
The installation file is relatively small, with a size of less than 10 MB.
